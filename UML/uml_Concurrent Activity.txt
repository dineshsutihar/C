* Chakkenges of Concurrency

Parallelism:-
Doing many things at the same time instead of sequentially 

Parallel computing is a type of computational in which many calculations are carried out simultaneously, 
oprtation on the principle that large problems can opten be divided into smaller ones, which are then solved at the same time.

The term parallelism refers to techniques to programs faster by performing several computations the samr time.

DATA Parallesim 
    Same computation being performed on a collection of incepedent items 
    EG. 
            Read a,b
            Pint a+b


CONCURRENCY: 
 
Concurency means multiple computations are happening at the same time.
    - Multiple computers in a Network
    - Multiple applications running on one computers
    - Multiple processors in a computer.

Concurrency is essential in modern programming;
    - Websites must handle multiple simultaneous users
    - Mobile apps need to do some of their processing on servers 
    - GUI almost always required background woek tht does not interrupt the user.


Here we have two models of Concurrent Programming:

SHARED MEMORY
 In the shared memoy, concurrent models intract by readeing and writing shared objects in memory.

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 SCHEDULING 
 Process scheduling is a essential part of multiprogramming of operation sustem.Such operating system allow more than one process to be loaded 
 into the executable memory at a time and the loaded process shares the CPU using time multiplexing.

 Scheduling Criteria:
 Scheduling criteria is also called as scheduling methodology.

  CPU utilization: Keep the CPU as busy as possible. It ranges from 0 to 100%.

  Throughput: It is the rate at which process are completed per unit of time.
  
  Turnaround time: This is the how long a process takes to execute a proces. it is calculated as the time gap between the submission of a process 
  and its competion.

  Waiting time: waiting time is the sum of time periods spent in waiting in the ready queue.

  Response time: It is the time it takes to start responding from submisson time. It is calculated as the amount of time it takes from whem a request
  was submitted until the first response is produced.

  ...................................................................................................................................
  CATEGORIES OF SCHEDULING:

  Non-Preemptive: The resource cannot be taken from a process until the process complete execution. The switching of resources occurs when the runnig 
  process terminates and moves to a waiting state.

  Preemptive: The operation system allocates the resurces to a process for a fixed amount of time. During resource allocation, the process switches 
  from running state to ready state or from waiting to ready state.

  This switchih occurs as the CPU may give priority to other processes and replace the process with higher priority with the running process.
  

  PROCESS SCHEDULING QUEUES:

    Job Queue: It keeps all the peocess in the system 

    Ready Queue: It keeps a set of all processes residing in main memory, ready and waiting to execute. A new process is alwas put in this queue.

    Device Queues: The processes which are blocked due to unavailablity of an I/O device constitute this queue.


 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 TWO-STATE PROCESS MODEL:

 RUNNING 
    When a new process is created, it enters into the system as in the running state 

NOT RUNNING 
    Process that are not running are kept in queue, waiting for their turn to execute.
    
    when a process is interrupted, that process is transferred in the waiting queue. If the process has completed or aborted, the process is discarded 

    


..................................................................................................................................................

DEADLOCK:
A deadlock is a situation in which two computer programs sharing the same resource are effectively preventing each other from accessing the resource.

Program 1 requests resource A and receives it.
Program 2 requests resource B and recieves it.
Program 1 requests resource B and is queued up, pending the release of B.
Program 2 requests resource A and is queued up, pending the release of A.


A deadlock in OS is a situation in which more than one process is blocked because it is holding a resources and also requires some resource that is 
acquired by some other process.

Condition for a deadlock to arise are as follows:

Mutual Exclusion:
Only one process can use a resource at any given time i.e. the resources are non-sharable.

Hold and wait:
A process is holding at least one resorce at a time and is waithing to acquire other resources held by some other process.

No Preemption:
The resource can be released by a process voluntarily i.e. after executon of the process.

Circular Wait:
A set of processes are waiting for each other in a circular fashion 

Advantage of Deadlock methodology

No preemption is needed for deadlocks.
It is a good method if the state of the resource can be saved and restored easily.
It is good for activities that perform a single brust of activity.
It does not need run-time computations because the program is solved in systme design.


Disadvantage of Deadlock Method 

The process must know the maximum resource of each type required to execute it .
Preemptions are frequently encountered.
It delays the process initiation.
There are inherent pre-emption losses.
It does not support incremental reequest of resources.

Sorting Networks:-

Sorting means arrange data/ elements either in ascending order/ descending order.

Descending Order:
- Searching for first highest
                second 
                third 
                fourth


Ascending Order:
- searching for first lowest
                second 
                third 
                fourth



Ascending Order:

if(a[i] > a[i+1])

temp=a[i]
a[i]=a[i+1]
a[i+1]=temp
